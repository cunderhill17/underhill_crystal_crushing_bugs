# Crushing Bugs Assignment
This repository is for the crushing bugs assignment in the Multimedia Authoring 2 Course in IDP3 @ Fanshawe in which we had fix two bugs within the drag and drop anatomy game completed during class. The original scope of the game allowed individuals to drag and drop labels into zones located over different anatomy sections of the given image. 

- The first bug involved being able to drop multiple labels into the same dropzones
- The second bug was the reset button not working to reset the locations of the labels after they were dragged and dropped in the drop zones
